\arguments{
\item{CDMdbHandler}{A CDMdbHandler object that contains database connection details}

\item{conceptIds}{Vector of concept IDs to get counts and relationships for}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{

\dontrun{
# Get code counts for specific concept IDs
result <- getCodeCounts(CDMdbHandler, conceptIds = c(317009))

# View concept relationships
print(result$concept_relationships)
